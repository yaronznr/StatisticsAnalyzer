Fitted values vs. residuals plot allow you to verify the residuals (nmodel errors) follows the same distribution<br>
for all regression values. This is an important assumption in linear regression inference.<br>
<br>
Reasons for not following the same distribution could be:<br>
1. Goodness of fit - model does not fill data well<br>
2. Missing interaction or other explanatory variables<br>
 <br>
Common plot shapes:<br>
1. Data fits expected distribution well:<br>

2. Examples were residuals distribution is not equal for all fitted values:<br>
