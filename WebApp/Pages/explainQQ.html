QQ plot allows you to examine how well model errors fits normal distribution.<br>
<br>
The plot contains the following items:<br>
1. Yellow dots - each dot represent a seperate model error (residual)<br>
2. Blue line - When data fits normal distribution perfectly all residuals lie on the blue line<br>
3. Red curves - These are the theoretic error confidence intervals where we expect residuals to lie<br>
<br>
Common QQ plot shapes:<br>
1. Data fits normal distribution well:<br>

2. Data does not fit normal distribution at all:<br>

3. Model has some deviation for normality. Examples: long tails that are not expected in normal distribution, non-continuous distribution nature:<br>

In some cases (especially when only rough assesment is needed) these are applicable.
