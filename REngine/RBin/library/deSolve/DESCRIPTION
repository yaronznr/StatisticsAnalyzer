Description: Functions that solve initial value problems of a system
        of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODE), of
        partial differential equations (PDE), of differential
        algebraic equations (DAE), and of delay differential
        equations.  The functions provide an interface to the FORTRAN
        functions lsoda, lsodar, lsode, lsodes of the ODEPACK
        collection, to the FORTRAN functions dvode and daspk and a
        C-implementation of solvers of the Runge-Kutta family with
        fixed or variable time steps.  The package contains routines
        designed for solving ODEs resulting from 1-D, 2-D and 3-D
        partial differential equations (PDE) that have been converted
        to ODEs by numerical differencing.
